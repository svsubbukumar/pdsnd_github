### Project Title
Bikeshare Data

### Description
This project is used to answer any questions the user might have about the bikeshare data files from chicago, new york, and washington. This includes travel time, popular start and end stations, rider information, and more.

### Files used
I used three (3) csv files: chicago.csv, new_york_city.csv, and washington.csv.

### Credits
I was inspired by this repo https://github.com/CarolB33/Bike-sharing-project/blob/master/bikeshare_2.py
